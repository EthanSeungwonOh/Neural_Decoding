# Online Transfer Learning in Neural_Decoding

## Description
The goal of this project is to propose a novel learning method for training real-time neural decoder models that continuously adapts to the data stream of neural activities extracted from the subject by exploiting knowledge from previous datasets in the stream and updating the model in an online fashion.
